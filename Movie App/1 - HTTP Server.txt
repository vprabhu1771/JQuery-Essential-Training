The error you're encountering, "Cross-Origin Request Blocked," is due to the Same Origin Policy, which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This policy is in place to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

In your case, you are running your HTML file from the local file system (`file:///D:/osome-movie-app/`), and you are trying to make an AJAX request to load a JSON file (`movies.json`) also from the local file system. Browsers often block such requests for security reasons.

To resolve this issue, consider using a local server to serve your files. You can use tools like Node.js with `http-server`, Python with `SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2) or `http.server` (for Python 3), or other similar tools.

Here's an example using Node.js and `http-server`:

1. Install `http-server` globally (if not installed):
   
   npm install -g http-server
   

2. Navigate to the directory containing your HTML and JSON files and run:
   
   http-server
   

3. Open your browser and access your files at `http://localhost:8080` (or another port).

This will start a local server, and you should be able to make AJAX requests without encountering the Cross-Origin Request Blocked error.

Remember to update your AJAX request URL to use the new server URL, for example:

$.getJSON("http://localhost:8080/movies.json", function(data) {
    // Your code here
});


Make sure to replace `"http://localhost:8080"` with the appropriate URL for your local server.
